/**
 * Adds a new deal to Firebase.
 *
 * This asynchronous function handles adding a new deal to Firebase based on values
 * validated by the `NewDealSchemaZodType` schema. It is intended for use in React applications
 * where form submissions are validated using Zod schemas before interacting with Firebase.
 *
 * @param {string} collectionName - Name of the collection we want to delete the deal from
 * @param {string} dealId - ID of the deal we want to delete
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Returns a promise that resolves once the deal has been added to Firebase.
